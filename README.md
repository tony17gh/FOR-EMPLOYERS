# FOR-EMPLOYERS

It's Tony. Thank you for considering my application!

This profile was made recently as I was locked out of my old Github account (containing all my projects) due to 2FA complications. 
I would be happy to discuss my projects to demonstrate my knowledge on their concepts, including their structure, code, and development history to verify that they are my work.

Your time and understanding is appreciated! ❤️
